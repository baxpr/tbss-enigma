# ENIGMA TBSS protocol

Source site: https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/dti-protocols/

Do we want ROI extraction for FA? The provided code for this is some C code / .exe files,
bash scripts, and R code so will need some work. Might be easier to rewrite based on
existing outputs and the ROI atlas (not sure yet where that is).

Do we want skeletonization and ROI extraction for MD, RD, AD, V1?
